                <h2>Where does the waste come from?</h2>
                <p>Most of us have heard by now that waste is a huge problem. Recycling has helped reduce the amount we send to landfill however it's not perfect and still costs money, water, and energy. Even with recycling, we have more waste than we know what to do with and it ends up in our oceans, rivers, streets, and all kinds of places it shouldn't be.</p>            
                <p>But who is making all this waste?</p>
                <p>Using the 2018-2019 data from Table 1 of Australian Bureau of Statistics <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/environment/environmental-management/waste-account-australia-experimental-estimates/latest-release#data-download">"Waste Account, Australia, Experimental Estimates"</a> dataset we can begin to piece together an answer.</p>
                <p>Lets take a closer look at where the waste comes from each day...</p>

                <p id="barChart"></p>
                <p>As we can see, the main offenders are manufacturing, construction, households, and utilities services. Utilities services refers to services such as electricity, gas, and water. </p>
                <p>It's easy to blame the large corporations for waste problems, however this visualisation makes it clear that households contribute to a significant amount of waste. This means some of the responsibility falls on us to recycle and avoid producing lots of waste.</p>
                <p>In order to reduce waste we need to know what kinds of waste are being produced.
                By splitting the data up by waste type, it allows us to see where we can cut down on waste.</p>

            <section class="part2">
                <h2>What is the waste made up of?</h2>
                <p>Let's take a closer look at types of waste that the main contributors made in 2018-2019...</p>

                <h2>What is the significance of this?</h2>
                <p>This chart brings to light numerous interesting and important findings. By clicking on each of the waste type buttons we can see exactly what kinds of waste make up these waste categories. 
                    Let's talk about some of the interesting findings from this visualisation.</p>
                <h3>Household organic waste</h3>
                <p>Organic waste makes up half of the waste generated by households. When we filter by organic it shows that half of organic waste is made up of food. That's a lot of food to be throwing away!</p>
                <h3>Household paper & cardboard waste</h3>
                <p>When filtering by paper & cardboard, it shows that a lot of this waste is made up of cardboard. A surprisingly large amount of the remaining waste is made up of newsprint and magazines. 
                    It could be argued that it is recycleable and of course not everyone has access to the internet for their news. However the process of recycling paper produces between 300kg CO2 per tonne of paper to 1450kg CO2 per tonne of paper 
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344910000911?via=ihub">(Laurijssen et al., 2010)</a> and is not a perfect solution. 
                    This highlights that where possible, newspapers and magazines should be bought only as needed.</p>
                <h3>Household plastic waste</h3>
                <p>It has become relatively common knoweledge that plastic wreaks havoc on the environment. Households are generating the largest percentage of plastic waste out of these industries.</p>
                <p>Most of this plastic waste is made up of PET and HDPE, which can be identified by a recycling symbol with a 1 or a 2 respectively. 
                    Both of these types of plastic make up things like bottles or containers and they can be recycled.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Table 2 <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/environment/environmental-management/waste-account-australia-experimental-estimates/latest-release#data-download">"Waste Account, Australia, Experimental Estimates",</a> 91% of PET plastics and 85% of HDPE plastics ended up in landfill. 
                    That's over 1 million tonnes of plastic in 2018-2019! This equates to 3077 tonnes of plastic waste from households across Australia each day.</p>
                <h3>Utilities services waste</h3>
                <p>Let's not forget that the utilities services produced a similar weight of waste as the other industries. 
                    A whopping 96% of that waste is ash! Most of the ash waste is "mixed with water to create a sludge which is pumped into large containment dams across Australia."
                    <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-10/coal-ash-has-become-one-of-australias-biggest-waste-problems/10886866">(Millington 2019)</a>
                    Without getting into the debated environmental and health concerns from these ash dams, having huge areas of ash lakes certainly isn't a benefit to the environment. 
                    It is space that can no longer be utilised by wildlife.</p>
                <h3>Construction and manufacturing masonry</h3>
                <p>A large percentage of the waste that comes out of manufacturing and construction is concrete and rubble. 
                    As long as these stay out of landfill, they are quite easy to recycle and not a huge cause for alarm. It's simply a matter of grinding up the concrete and removing debris such as wood or metals. 
                    Then it can be re-used in construction or as a cheap alternative to gravel in home garden projects. <a href="https://www.metropolitantransferstation.com.au/blog/alternative-uses-for-recycled-concrete/">(Alternative Uses for Recycled Concrete 2018)</a></p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>It's important to remember that not everything can be blamed on the corporations. Households are among the top contributors of waste and produce an alarming amount of plastic and food waste. 
                    Furthermore, there is an unnecessary amount of newsprint and magazine waste. </p> 
                <p>Living in extravagance is no longer an option and we all need to make changes in our buying habits. 
                    Think twice about buying magazines or plastic figurines and toys that get thrown out each year. 
                    Make meal plans or consider composting so as to avoid wasting food. Cutting down on your power usage (from the grid) not only makes a difference to your pocket, but reduces the ash produced by power stations. </p> 
                <p>As individuals we need to focus on making tonne of difference in this world each year, not a tonne of waste. </p>
